Usually, two types of approach can be found for the recommendation system, for instance, collaborative filtering, and content based filtering. Recommender systems are an important class of machine learning algorithms that offer "relevant" suggestions to users. Categorized as either collaborative filtering or a content-based system. Many algorithms have been used in measuring user similarity or item similarity in recommender systems. For example, the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) approach and the Pearson Correlation. In this repository, I have endeavoured to make recommendation system based on the various approach.
